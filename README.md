## Installation
No external libraries are required to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

## Project Motivation
This project motivation comes from Udacity's online course for Data Scientist Nanodegree project. 
The main interest to the project is finding a solution to the following questions.

* How does the listings  vary according to the bedroom size and the type of the property? 
* How is the interaction of host with their client affected based on their Acceptance rate, Response Rate and Response Time?
* What are the important features that estimates the price of a certain Property?

The above questions are the structure that defines the entire project.

## File Description
There is a jupyter notebook available here to dealwith the above questions. The notebook follows the CRISP-DM process of understanding the business and the data, preparation of data, modelling and consequently, model evaluation. Markdown cells have been used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The results of the project and the findings can be found in the code itself. It deals with the questions addressed in the motivation section.
